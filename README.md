h1>Code-A-Pookalam: The TinkerHub CUSAT Hackathon </h1>
This project, titled "Digital Pookalam," was created for the Code a Pookalam hackathon, conducted by TinkerHub CUSAT. The goal was to build a responsive web page that draws a digital Pookalam using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The result is a dynamic floral design rendered on a canvas element, with a layered pattern of different shapes and colors that adapts to any screen size.

ðŸŒº Pookalams are a beautiful expression of art, community, and devotion, with their designs often featuring geometric shapes, natural motifs, and a kaleidoscope of colors. The process of creating them is a communal activity, bringing families and neighbors together.
